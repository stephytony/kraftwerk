## Link to Jupyter Notebook Link -> 

## Introduction : 

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the Application Assignment 5.1. This takes a sample jupyter notebook to complete the exercise to analyse data in couspons.csv file in the data folder of this repository to determine the features that indicate whether a Driver will accept coupons “right away” or “later before the coupon expires”.

## Project Agenda : 

To identify the factors that contribute more to the coupon acceptance among customers.

## Files explained : 

    1. data/coupons.csv -> Original dataset
    2. images -> plots and visualizations
    3. prompt.ipnyb -> Data analysis - Notebook

## Tools and Libraries : 

    - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) → data cleaning, preprocessing, grouping  
    - [numpy](https://numpy.org/) → numerical operations  
    - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) & [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) → visualizations  
    - [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) → interactive exploration 

## Independent Analysis :
